# julia-cnn
Automatic differentiation algorithm in Julia and its performance against Pytorch library in a convolutional neural network.

The Julia model was made from scratch and backward propagation is made thanks to the automatic differentation algorithm which uses a computation graph to calculate gradients that are essential for learning the net. The next step was building the same architecture of the CNN in Pytorch and performing some speed and efficiency tests.
